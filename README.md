### What is Artcade?
Artcade is a collection of simple games. A sprite template is provided by Artcade that users can use to add their own drawings into the games. It's as simple as it sounds!

### Why use Artcade?
The simplest use is for prototyping sprites, and getting a feel for what drawings would look like in action. This isn't the only use for it, it's all completely up to the users.

### It's not working, what should I do?
